# Donately Integration

This is a WordPress plugin I'm working on publicly to integrate Donately more tightly into the website of a NGO I volunteer for. Features will be added to support that organization's specific needs but I'm trying to build everything so that it can be used by anyone and testing against a clean install of Twenty Twenty Two in addition to their website.

I have no affiliation with Donately. You're welcome to use this code or submit issues / PRs.
